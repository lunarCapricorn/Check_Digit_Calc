# Check_Digit_Calc
 
This app calculates the check digit number of the inputted MRZ -- Machine Readable Zone.

There are two ways to input MRZ:
1. In the terminal;
2. And in the 'values.txt' file.

Once the result is displayed, all the calculations will be stored in the 'logs.txt' file.

For personal safety, make sure to clear both the values and logs file after use. ;)
